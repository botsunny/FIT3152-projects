This repository collects the reports (as well as the R Markdown files to generate them) I wrote for the three assignments given in FIT3152 - Data analytics, a data science unit at Monash University. I created this repo to demonstrate my R code as well as the quality of my data analyses, visualisations and reports.

# Assignment 1

In this assignment, the data analysed is results from a baseline study conducted to identify the most important predictors of pro-social COVID-19 behaviours (ie. actions that reduce the spread of the virus). In addition to analysing the overall data, the report also places focus on a single country, in my case the United States.

Grade obtained: 38/40

# Assignment 2

This assignment focuses on the construction of classification models and the study of its predictions. The data consists of meteorological observations in Australia as attributes, and "more humid tomorrow" (whether this day is more humid than the previous) as the class attribute.

Grade obtained: 35/35

# Assignment 3

In this assignment, I collected a corpus of documents, `docs`, and analysed the relationships between the documents themselves as well as the words within the documents.

Grade obtained: 33/34
